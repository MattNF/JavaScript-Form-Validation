# JavaScript-Form-Validation
# This is a form validator built in JavaScript that checks for a proper username, password, and email. 
# It also ensures that each of these meets some level of minimum requirements using regular expressions.

# For example, password complexity checks for one uppercase letter, one numeric character, one special character. etc. The background color is also changed
# based on the password complexity (weak, medium, strong, very strong, etc)
